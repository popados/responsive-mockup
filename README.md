# Readme File | Responsive Website

> This project will help you begin training yourself to visualize grid layouts and flex containers in "design".

> As a developer, you will be given a design and expected to "translate" it into HTML and CSS - and even further, recognize architectural patterns where grid layouts and flexbox patterns will be utilized.
